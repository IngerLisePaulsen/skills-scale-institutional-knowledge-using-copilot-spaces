# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme uses a customer-first approach, iterative delivery, and clear roles. Each project starts with a validated one-pager, moves through planning and backlog creation, and executes via managed sprints and milestones. Quality assurance practices include reviews, test coverage, and risk monitoring. Roles are explicit: Project Managers drive delivery and risk tracking, Product Managers define value and priorities, Developers own implementation and quality. Communication is structured: regular stakeholder updates, standups, and demos ensure transparency throughout the lifecycle.

This centralizes process knowledge, reduces dependency on individual expertise, and ensures repeatable, scalable workflows for every project type.
